 * Sets a scaling factor for the priority of the task. The scaling factor is a

 * priority and 1.0 is considered the highest.
 *
 * The priority is a hint and not a hard requirement of task performance. The
 * priority of a task may be changed using this API at any time, but not all
 * protocols support this; in these cases, the last priority that took effect
 * will be used.
 *
 * If no priority is specified, the task will operate with the default priority
 * as defined by the constant NSURLSessionTaskPriorityDefault. Two additional
 * priority levels are provided: NSURLSessionTaskPriorityLow and
 * NSURLSessionTaskPriorityHigh, but use is not restricted to these.
